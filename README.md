# micromanager2
A CMake enabled version of Micromanager from https://www.micro-manager.org/wiki/Micro-Manager_Source_Code

This code follows the principle of CMake with an out-of-source build and without using any hand-rolled solution files. Currently this project should compile under Windows (MSVC). Porting it to Mac OSX and Linux will involving setting the required preprocessor macros.
